                <h4>Ever heard of a liquid face lift? Did you know collagen can be stimulated with injections? </h4>

                <p>Innovation in aesthetic medicine has advanced considerably since Botox made its mark (and started smoothing over them), and there are now injectables available to solve a wide range of problems.</p>

                <br>

                <blockquote>
                    Many treatments that were once treated with surgery are now fixed safely with non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques. This is what Beyoutiful brings to the table, nurturing a safe space whilst providing swift treatments for enhancements.  <br><br>

                    -<i>Dr Wesley Tan, Medical Director</i>
                </blockquote>

                <br>
                
                <p>Dr Tan is here to share valuable expertise and insights with regards to this dynamic area of aesthetics during the interview conducted with him.  </p>

                <h4>WHY DO YOU LIKE WORKING WITH INJECTABLES? </h4>

                
                <p>Injectables brings many benefits to the table, and serve as great tools. They offer a diverse range of benefits to personalise solutions for every patient. The face treatment services that we offer targets the following: from lifting and tightening to smoothing and volumising. Non-invasive facial rejuvenation techniques, such as Botox, Fillers, Profhilo, Rejuran Healer, HIFU and Pico Laser can be combined to great effect. After being in this industry for many years, it is wondrous to observe the growth and advancements of such aesthetic technqiues. </p>
                
                <h4>HOW CAN INJECTABLES BE TAILORED AND PERSONALISED FOR EACH PATIENT?</h4>
                
                <p>It is the meeting of art and science. It is my mission to create holistic therapies targeted at individual needs, so as to correct targeted issues from multiple angles whilst cultivating better skin health. I believe in the appreciation for unique features which elevates my client's confidence. </p>

            <h4>WHICH INJECTABLES PROVIDE THE BEST RESULTS? </h4>

            <p>Each treatment that BeYoutiful offers promises swift and efficient results. We value safety and transparency in the treatments which we offer. They all work to achieve different things, hence it is crucial to understand the pain-points or places which require enhancements in the face. It is important to target the cause and not just soley relieve the symptoms. Let me share with you some knowledge of my favourite injectables and their qualities that paramounts to achieving good results. <br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Botox</b>: Good for smoothing lines, shaping and lifting the brows and feminising the jawline. </li>
                <li><b>Profhilo</b>: Redesigned to remodel the skin and stimulate collagen.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <br>
                        
            </p>
            
            <h4>WHERE SHOULD SOMEONE START WITH INJECTABLES?</h4>

            <p>Opening up the eyes is a good place to start. Lifting the brow and smoothing fine lines with Botox is the foundation of rejuvenation with injectables. My guideline is to start at the top of the face and work down the face over time. Aging goes hand in hand with gravity, hence altering things on the upper third of the face first helps indicate what should be done on the middle and lower thirds. This leads to a more harmonious look. </p>
            
            <h4>WHAT RESULTS DO YOU SEE FROM INJECTABLES?</h4>
            
            <p> Injectables help to fill areas that have deflated, relax the areas that are overactive and tighten areas which require rejuvenation. Ultimately, we want our customers to be confident and satsifed with their overall image. Our mission is to unlock the natural radiance in every individual, renewing your confidence and balance so that you feel beautiful in your own skin. </p>
